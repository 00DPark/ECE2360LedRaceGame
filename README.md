# ECE2360LedRaceGame
There will be 2 players that will use 2 joysticks both will control separate LED matrix that will move within a maze of leds with borders and obstacles this will primarily be done on the MAX2719. Movement must be very precise as if player moves led out of bounds they have to start over. LED can only move one spot at a time corresponding to joycon position, and the joycon position must be at 0 for LED to move again. Players are competing against each other to see who can reach the end the fastest. The game is timed and the time will show on the LCD display When some player finishes a buzzer will buzz and time of winner will be displayed on the LCD display along with both peopleâ€™s times. To play again one must press a button on the breadboard and then it will reset!
